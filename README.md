VEI is a deterministic, MCP-native enterprise simulator for training, evaluating, and replaying agent behavior against synthetic business systems. The stable boundary is the world kernel: a `WorldSession` owns world state, event queues, snapshots, branches, replay, injection, actor state, and receipts.

## What VEI Can Simulate

Plainly: VEI can simulate an enterprise environment where an agent has to discover what systems exist, inspect state, take actions, coordinate across tools, and satisfy business constraints over time.

- Time and state
  - Virtual time, scheduled events, pending work, snapshots, branches, replay, and restore
- Software surfaces
  - Slack, Mail, Browser, Docs, Spreadsheet, Tickets, CRM, ERP, Okta-style identity, ServiceDesk, Google Admin, SIEM, Datadog, PagerDuty, feature flags, HRIS, and Jira-style issues
- Enterprise artifacts
  - Documents, workbooks, tickets, incidents, alerts, flags, identity records, deals, comments, and audit-like receipts
- Long-horizon work
  - Multi-step tasks that cross systems, have hidden state, require follow-through, and can fail midway
- Policies and outcomes
  - Success predicates, forbidden states, policy invariants, observation boundaries, deadlines, and contract-graded outcomes
- Agent discoverability
  - Capability graphs, orientation summaries, policy hints, key objects, suggested next inspection focuses, and graph-native plan/action surfaces
- Humans and interventions
  - Multiple actors, approvals, injected events, branch-and-recover flows, and replayable operator intervention

## Core Primitives

VEI now exposes one coherent product shape:

- `Blueprint`: typed composition of scenario, facades, workflow, and contract
- `BlueprintAsset`: authored blueprint root that declares a scenario template, capability-graph or environment seed, requested facades, workflow, and metadata
- `CompiledBlueprint`: compiled blueprint with resolved facades, state roots, workflow defaults, contract defaults, and run defaults
- `GroundingBundle`: typed imported org/policy/incident input that compiles into a `BlueprintAsset`
- `ImportPackage`: raw CSV/JSON enterprise export pack plus mapping profiles, redaction state, and provenance anchors
- `Workspace`: file-backed environment root that stores blueprint, contracts, scenarios, imports, runs, and artifacts
- `Scenario`: seeded enterprise world and difficulty/tool manifest
- `Facade`: typed enterprise surface grouped by capability domain
- `Contract`: success predicates, forbidden predicates, observation boundary, policy invariants, reward terms, and intervention rules
- `Run`: workflow, benchmark, demo, and suite executions over the same world kernel
- `Snapshot`: branchable world-state checkpoint with replay and receipts

The older per-app router twins are still used, but they are now wrapped as a typed facade catalog rather than presented as the product ontology by themselves.

VEI is semantic-first today. VM-backed desktop or OS-level facades can come later as plugins, but the current engine is intentionally focused on compiling organization state and policies into a deterministic world before adding heavier substrates.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[llm,sse,ui]"
```

### Configure `.env`

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
VEI_SEED=42042
VEI_ARTIFACTS_DIR=./_vei_out
```

### Verify the repo

```bash
make setup
make check
make test
make llm-live
vei-smoke --transport stdio --timeout-s 30
```

`make llm-live` auto-loads `.env` when present and writes `summary.json` next to the other live-run artifacts under `_vei_out/llm_live/latest`.

### Run a live episode

```bash
vei-llm-test \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --task "Research price, get Slack approval under budget, and email vendor for quote."
```

### Workspace and UI flow

```bash
vei project init --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover --example acquired_user_cutover
vei contract validate --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover
vei run start --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover --runner workflow
vei ui serve --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover
```

The standalone UI alias works too:

```bash
vei-ui serve --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover
```

The unified root CLI exposes the same lifecycle:

```bash
vei project show --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover
vei scenario preview --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover
vei inspect events --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover
vei inspect graphs --root _vei_out/workspaces/acquired_cutover --domain identity_graph
```

### Grounded import flow

VEI can now ingest realistic offline enterprise export packs and turn them into a runnable workspace. The import path is:

```text
raw CSV/JSON exports -> import package -> review/override -> normalized grounding bundle -> compiled workspace
```

Canonical fixture demo:

If you are running from a source checkout, the bundled fixture lives under `vei/imports/fixtures/`. In an installed environment, resolve its packaged path with `python -c "from vei.imports.api import get_import_package_example_path; print(get_import_package_example_path('macrocompute_identity_export'))"`.

```bash
cp -R vei/imports/fixtures/macrocompute_identity_export _vei_out/import_packages/macrocompute_identity_export
vei project validate-import --package _vei_out/import_packages/macrocompute_identity_export
vei project review-import --package _vei_out/import_packages/macrocompute_identity_export
vei project scaffold-overrides --package _vei_out/import_packages/macrocompute_identity_export --source-id okta_users
vei project normalize --package _vei_out/import_packages/macrocompute_identity_export
vei project import --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import --package _vei_out/import_packages/macrocompute_identity_export
vei scenario generate --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import
vei scenario activate --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import --scenario-name oversharing_remediation --bootstrap-contract
vei run start --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import --runner workflow --scenario-name oversharing_remediation
vei inspect provenance --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import --object-ref drive_share:DOC-ACQ-1
vei-ui serve --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import
```

If you want the shortest end-to-end grounded identity flow, VEI now ships a single command that prepares the workspace, generates/activates the right scenario, bootstraps the contract, and can launch the baseline plus scripted comparison runs:

```bash
vei project identity-demo --root _vei_out/workspaces/identity_demo --overwrite
vei-ui serve --root _vei_out/workspaces/identity_demo
```

Live source sync uses the same persisted import-package model. For the first connector-backed path, point VEI at a read-only Okta config JSON:

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://your-org.okta.com",
  "token_env": "OKTA_API_TOKEN",
  "organization_name": "Your Organization",
  "organization_domain": "example.com"
}
```

Then sync it into an existing workspace:

```bash
vei project sync-source --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import --connector okta --config _vei_out/okta.json
vei project review-import --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import
vei project compile --root _vei_out/workspaces/macrocompute_import
```

The import UI now shows:
- package/source summary
- connected source registry and sync history
- mapping diagnostics
- identity reconciliation across imported users, employees, managers, and share principals
- suggested override locations and applied source overrides
- generated scenario candidates
- imported vs derived vs simulated counts
- contract rule provenance, including which rules were imported vs inferred
- active generated-scenario promotion into the workspace run path
- provenance drilldown from selected run events

## What You Get

- Deterministic simulator with replayable traces
- Stable world-kernel API with snapshot, branch, restore, replay, inject, and event inspection
- File-backed workspaces that keep blueprint assets, contracts, scenarios, runs, and artifacts together
- Typed blueprint and facade catalog over the existing enterprise twins
- Blueprint compiler with explicit facade plugins and authored `GroundingBundle -> BlueprintAsset -> CompiledBlueprint` flow
- Environment-builder path that can compile typed capability graphs, policies, and workflow seeds into a runnable world session
- Grounded import pipeline that can validate file-based identity exports, normalize them into a `GroundingBundle`, generate scenario candidates, bootstrap contracts, and preserve provenance/redaction artifacts inside a workspace
- Multi-source identity reconciliation that explains how Okta-style users, HRIS employees, manager references, and share/request principals were resolved, left unmatched, or marked external
- Connector-backed import pipeline that can sync a live read-only Okta snapshot into the same canonical `ImportPackage -> GroundingBundle -> Workspace` ladder used by file exports
- Runtime capability-graph layer that lets world sessions and snapshots expose shared domain graphs such as identity, docs, work, comms, and revenue
- Graph-native planning and mutation layer that lets agents ask for suggested next actions and apply graph actions without dropping down to raw app tools first
- Graph-native workflow execution, so benchmark/playbook steps can compile to `vei.graph_action` instead of only raw app-shaped tool calls
- Agent-orientation layer that lets sessions and snapshots expose agent-facing summaries of visible surfaces, active policies, key objects, and suggested next questions
- Enterprise twins for Slack, Mail, Browser, Docs, Spreadsheet, Tickets, DB, ERP/CRM, Okta-style identity, ServiceDesk, Google Admin, SIEM, Datadog, PagerDuty, feature flags, HRIS, and Jira-style issue flows
- Scenario compilation, dataset rollout, BC training, benchmark execution, and release packaging
- Reusable benchmark families for security containment, enterprise onboarding/migration, and revenue incident response
- Curated complex-example showcase bundles for security incidents, acquired-user cutovers, and revenue-critical mixed-stack mitigations
- Local playback UI for completed and in-flight workspace runs, including timeline, orientation, capability graphs, snapshots, diffs, and contract outcome panels
- Canonical append-only run event stream that drives playback, `vei inspect events`, receipts, contract status, and snapshot markers across workflow, scripted, BC, and LLM runs

## Architecture

```text
Agent ──MCP──► VEI Router
                  └─ transport + tool dispatch
                            │
                            ▼

```

## Next Phase

The current execution-ready roadmap lives in [docs/NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md](docs/NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md).

In one line: the next phase is about making `vei.run` the canonical execution spine and making VEI much stronger at turning messy enterprise exports into runnable, inspectable, contract-graded identity environments.

## Use It As A Library

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/strangeloopcanon/digital-enterprise-twin.git@main"
```

For the full product workflow, including the local UI and live LLM runs:

```bash
pip install -e ".[llm,sse,ui]"
```

SDK embedding:

```python
from vei.sdk import create_session

session = create_session(seed=42042, scenario_name="multi_channel")
obs = session.observe()
page = session.call_tool("browser.read", {})
```

World-kernel embedding:

```python
from vei.world.api import create_world_session, get_catalog_scenario

world = create_world_session(
    seed=42042,
    scenario=get_catalog_scenario("multi_channel"),
)
obs = world.observe()
snapshot = world.snapshot("before-run")
events = world.list_events()
```

Useful helpers:

- Scenario manifests: `list_scenario_manifest()`, `get_scenario_manifest(name)`
- Facade catalog: `list_facade_manifest_entries()`, `get_facade_manifest_entry(name)`
- Blueprint catalog: `list_blueprint_entries()`, `build_blueprint_asset_for_family_entry(name)`, `build_blueprint_for_family_entry(name)`, `compile_blueprint_entry(asset)`
- Environment builder: `list_blueprint_builder_examples_entries()`, `build_blueprint_asset_for_example_entry(name)`, `create_world_session_from_blueprint_entry(asset)`
- Workspace lifecycle: `create_workspace_from_template_entry(...)`, `import_workspace_entry(...)`, `compile_workspace_entry(...)`, `show_workspace_entry(...)`
- Import helpers: `list_import_package_example_entries()`, `validate_import_package_entry(path)`, `review_import_package_entry(path)`, `scaffold_mapping_override_entry(path, source_id=...)`, `normalize_import_package_entry(path)`, `load_workspace_import_review_entry(root)`, `load_workspace_provenance_entry(root, object_ref)`
- Run lifecycle: `launch_workspace_run_entry(...)`, `list_run_manifests_entry(...)`, `get_run_orientation_entry(...)`, `get_run_capability_graphs_entry(...)`
- Benchmark families: `list_benchmark_family_manifest_entries()`, `get_benchmark_family_manifest_entry(name)`

## Primary Commands

```bash
make setup
make check
make test
make llm-live
make deps-audit
make all
```

If you do not have LLM credentials:

```bash
VEI_LLM_LIVE_BYPASS=1 make llm-live
```

## Supported CLI Surface

- Start here
  - `vei project|contract|scenario|run|inspect|ui`
  - `vei ui serve` or `vei-ui serve`
- Expert tools
  - `vei-world`
  - `vei-blueprint bundle|bundles|asset|compile|show|observe|orient|examples|facades`
  - `vei-visualize replay|flow|dashboard|export`
- Evaluation and release
  - `vei-eval`, `vei-eval-frontier`, `vei-rollout`, `vei-train`, `vei-score`, `vei-release`
- Catalog/debug surfaces
  - `vei-scenarios list|manifest|dump`
  - `vei-smoke`, `vei-demo`, `vei-det sample-workflow|compile-workflow|run-workflow|generate-corpus|filter-corpus`

`vei inspect graphs` is now the broadest product/workspace graph surface. It can inspect `identity_graph`, `doc_graph`, `work_graph`, `comm_graph`, `revenue_graph`, `ops_graph`, `obs_graph`, and `data_graph` from a recorded run. `vei-world graphs` remains the expert snapshot-level surface and currently focuses on `comm_graph`, `doc_graph`, `work_graph`, `identity_graph`, and `revenue_graph`. `vei-world orient` and `vei-blueprint orient` add the agent-facing layer on top: visible surfaces, active policy hints, key objects, and suggested next questions.

Inside live MCP sessions, agents can now call the same discoverability surfaces directly with `vei.orientation`, `vei.capability_graphs`, `vei.graph_plan`, and `vei.graph_action`.

Graph-native agent ladder:

```text
vei.orientation
  -> what kind of world is this?
vei.capability_graphs
  -> what shared domain state exists?
vei.graph_plan
  -> what graph-native actions make sense next?
vei.graph_action
  -> apply one of those actions through the real twins
```

The workflow layer now uses the same abstraction too: flagship onboarding and revenue/ops workflows execute graph-native steps internally and only resolve down to concrete twins at runtime.

## Workspace And Playback UI

The default product-shaped loop is now:

1. `vei project init` or `vei project import`
2. `vei project compile` when you want to refresh compiled artifacts after editing the workspace; `init`, `import`, and `run start` already compile for you
3. `vei contract validate` and `vei scenario preview`
4. `vei run start --runner workflow|scripted|bc|llm`
5. `vei inspect orient|graphs|events|snapshots|diff|receipts`
6. `vei ui serve` or `vei-ui serve`

The local UI stays intentionally lightweight and Python-first. It opens one workspace, shows compiled scenario and contract context, launches runs with scenario/runner/provider/model/task/max-step controls, and renders a playback control room with animated channel lanes, run scorecards, capability-graph summaries, orientation cards, snapshot diffs, and raw developer drawers over the same canonical run artifacts.

Run playback is now driven by the canonical append-only event spine, so live and completed runs share the same source of truth for contract updates, snapshot markers, resolved tools, and graph-native intents like `identity_graph.assign_application` or `doc_graph.restrict_drive_share`.

![VEI UI control room](docs/assets/vei_ui_control_room.png)

Imported workspaces add a grounded-intake layer on top of that same UI: source-package health, normalization diagnostics, scenario candidates, imported/derived/simulated object counts, and provenance drilldown from timeline events to raw-source lineage.

## Benchmarking

Baseline run:

```bash
export VEI_ARTIFACTS_DIR=_vei_out/llmtest
VEI_SEED=42042 vei-llm-test \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --max-steps 32 \
  --task "Open product page, cite specs, post approval under $3200, email sales@macrocompute.example for a quote, wait for reply."
vei-score --artifacts-dir _vei_out/llmtest --success-mode full
```

Kernel-backed benchmark run:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner scripted \
  --scenario multi_channel \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id scripted_multi
```

Family-level benchmark run:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner workflow \
  --family security_containment \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id security_workflow
```

Explicit workflow selection for a single scenario:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner workflow \
  --scenario oauth_app_containment \
  --workflow-name security_containment \
  --workflow-variant internal_only_review \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id security_named_workflow
```

Scripted or LLM family runs stay on the same pipeline:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner scripted \
  --family security_containment \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id security_family
```

Canonical family demo flow:

```bash
vei-eval demo \
  --family security_containment \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/demo \
  --run-id security_demo
```

That command runs the deterministic family workflow baseline plus a comparison runner, writes `leaderboard.md` / `leaderboard.csv` / `leaderboard.json`, stores inspectable world state under `_vei_out/demo/security_demo/state` for follow-up `vei-world` inspection, and records explicit `contract.json` artifacts for both the baseline and comparison paths. Contract evaluation now separates oracle state from agent-visible observation so hidden state can be graded without making the demo omniscient.

Complex-example showcase bundle:

```bash
vei-eval showcase \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/showcase \
  --run-id flagship_examples
```

That command runs three curated complex examples and writes one top-level `showcase_overview.md` bundle plus per-example demo artifacts:

- `oauth_incident_chain`: Google Admin + SIEM + Jira + Docs + Slack
- `acquired_seller_cutover`: HRIS + Okta + Google Admin + Salesforce + Jira + Docs + Slack
- `checkout_revenue_flightdeck`: Datadog + PagerDuty + feature flags + Spreadsheet + Docs + CRM + Tickets + Slack

It is the cleanest supported way to show that VEI can execute long-horizon, cross-surface enterprise tasks rather than only single-family demos.

Flagship blueprint-driven revenue/ops demo:

```bash
vei-blueprint asset \
  --family revenue_incident_mitigation \
  --workflow-variant revenue_ops_flightdeck

vei-blueprint compile \
  --family revenue_incident_mitigation \
  --workflow-variant revenue_ops_flightdeck

vei-eval demo \
  --family revenue_incident_mitigation \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/demo \
  --run-id revenue_ops_demo
```

That flow shows the full engine shape: authored `BlueprintAsset`, compiled blueprint, the deterministic workflow baseline, a freer comparison run, `contract.json`, and inspectable state/snapshot artifacts. The flagship revenue workflow now spans Spreadsheet, Docs, CRM, feature flags, Datadog, PagerDuty, Tickets, and Slack in one mixed-stack run.

Flagship environment-builder example for the identity/access-governance wedge:

```bash
vei-blueprint examples

vei-blueprint bundle \
  --example acquired_user_cutover

vei-blueprint asset \
  --example acquired_user_cutover

vei-blueprint compile \
  --example acquired_user_cutover

vei-blueprint observe \
  --example acquired_user_cutover \
  --focus slack
```

That flow shows the full builder ladder: raw grounding bundle, authored blueprint asset, compiled blueprint, and then a live world observation. The current built-in identity wedge compiles capability graphs for HRIS, Okta-style identity, Google Drive sharing state, Jira tracking, docs, Slack, and CRM handoff.

Agent-facing builder orientation:

```bash
vei-blueprint orient \
  --example acquired_user_cutover
```

That command renders the compiled blueprint, runtime capability graphs, and a concise orientation payload for the live world. It is the cleanest single command for showing what an LLM can discover about the environment before acting.

Canonical multi-family workflow suite:

```bash
vei-eval suite \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/suite \
  --run-id nightly_suite
```

That command runs each family's primary workflow variant and writes stable `leaderboard.*` artifacts plus `suite_result.json`, which makes it a good fit for CI or nightly publishing. Each family case also writes a `contract.json` artifact so the suite has an explicit contract layer, not just score files.

Frontier batch for one model:

```bash
vei-eval-frontier run \
  --runner llm \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --scenario-set reasoning \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/frontier_eval
```

Artifacts from batch evaluation include:

- `aggregate_results.json`
- per-scenario `benchmark_result.json`
- benchmark runs also write `blueprint_asset.json`
- benchmark runs also write `blueprint.json`
- `benchmark_summary.json`
- benchmark-family runs also write `contract.json`
- demo runs also write `leaderboard.md`, `leaderboard.csv`, `leaderboard.json`, and `demo_result.json`
- suite runs also write `leaderboard.md`, `leaderboard.csv`, `leaderboard.json`, and `suite_result.json`
- family-level dimension scores such as evidence preservation, blast radius, least privilege, oversharing avoidance, deadline compliance, revenue impact handling, artifact follow-through, comms correctness, and safe rollback

Render a report from any benchmark or frontier batch:

```bash
vei-report generate \
  --root _vei_out/frontier_eval/<run-id> \
  --format markdown \
  --output LEADERBOARD.md
```

## Release Bundles

```bash
vei-release dataset \
  --input-path _vei_out/rollout.json \
  --label rollout \
  --version v20260310

vei-release benchmark \
  --benchmark-dir _vei_out/benchmark/scripted_multi \
  --label scripted-benchmark \

## Examples

- `examples/sdk_playground_min.py`
- `examples/mcp_client_stdio_min.py`
- `examples/rl_train.py`

## Docs

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`

## Contributor Notes

`bd` state is local-only under `.beads/` and should stay out of Git.

## Workspace Hygiene

The repo source of truth is:

- `vei/`
- `tests/`
- `docs/`
- `tools/`
- top-level config such as `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, and `.agents.yml`

Local-only generated folders such as `_vei_out/`, `.artifacts/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, and `vei.egg-info/` are disposable.

To prune local clutter while keeping the current canonical demo, latest live artifact, reusable datasets, your virtualenv, local `bd` state, and local Codex state:

```bash
make clean-workspace
```

`archive_data/` is intentionally left alone by that target because it may contain local imported source data rather than regenerated outputs.
