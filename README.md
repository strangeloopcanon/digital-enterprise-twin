VEI is a deterministic, MCP-native enterprise simulator for training, evaluating, and replaying agent behavior against synthetic business systems. The stable boundary is the world kernel: a `WorldSession` owns world state, event queues, snapshots, branches, replay, injection, actor state, and receipts.

## What VEI Can Simulate

Plainly: VEI can simulate an enterprise environment where an agent has to discover what systems exist, inspect state, take actions, coordinate across tools, and satisfy business constraints over time.

- Time and state
  - Virtual time, scheduled events, pending work, snapshots, branches, replay, and restore
- Software surfaces
  - Slack, Mail, Browser, Docs, Spreadsheet, Tickets, CRM, ERP, Okta-style identity, ServiceDesk, Google Admin, SIEM, Datadog, PagerDuty, feature flags, HRIS, and Jira-style issues
- Enterprise artifacts
  - Documents, workbooks, tickets, incidents, alerts, flags, identity records, deals, comments, and audit-like receipts
- Long-horizon work
  - Multi-step tasks that cross systems, have hidden state, require follow-through, and can fail midway
- Policies and outcomes
  - Success predicates, forbidden states, policy invariants, observation boundaries, deadlines, and contract-graded outcomes
- Agent discoverability
  - Capability graphs, orientation summaries, policy hints, key objects, and suggested next inspection focuses
- Humans and interventions
  - Multiple actors, approvals, injected events, branch-and-recover flows, and replayable operator intervention

## Core Primitives

VEI now exposes one coherent product shape:

- `Blueprint`: typed composition of scenario, facades, workflow, and contract
- `BlueprintAsset`: authored blueprint root that declares a scenario template, capability-graph or environment seed, requested facades, workflow, and metadata
- `CompiledBlueprint`: compiled blueprint with resolved facades, state roots, workflow defaults, contract defaults, and run defaults
- `GroundingBundle`: typed imported org/policy/incident input that compiles into a `BlueprintAsset`
- `Scenario`: seeded enterprise world and difficulty/tool manifest
- `Facade`: typed enterprise surface grouped by capability domain
- `Contract`: success predicates, forbidden predicates, observation boundary, policy invariants, reward terms, and intervention rules
- `Run`: workflow, benchmark, demo, and suite executions over the same world kernel
- `Snapshot`: branchable world-state checkpoint with replay and receipts

The older per-app router twins are still used, but they are now wrapped as a typed facade catalog rather than presented as the product ontology by themselves.

VEI is semantic-first today. VM-backed desktop or OS-level facades can come later as plugins, but the current engine is intentionally focused on compiling organization state and policies into a deterministic world before adding heavier substrates.

## Use It As A Library

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/strangeloopcanon/digital-enterprise-twin.git@main"
```

SDK embedding:

```python
from vei.sdk import create_session

session = create_session(seed=42042, scenario_name="multi_channel")
obs = session.observe()
page = session.call_tool("browser.read", {})
```

World-kernel embedding:

```python
from vei.world.api import create_world_session

world = create_world_session(seed=42042, scenario_name="multi_channel")
obs = world.observe()
snapshot = world.snapshot("before-run")
events = world.list_events()
```

Useful helpers:

- Scenario manifests: `list_scenario_manifest()`, `get_scenario_manifest(name)`
- Facade catalog: `list_facade_manifest_entries()`, `get_facade_manifest_entry(name)`
- Blueprint catalog: `list_blueprint_entries()`, `build_blueprint_asset_for_family_entry(name)`, `build_blueprint_for_family_entry(name)`, `compile_blueprint_entry(asset)`
- Environment builder: `list_blueprint_builder_examples_entries()`, `build_blueprint_asset_for_example_entry(name)`, `create_world_session_from_blueprint_entry(asset)`
- Benchmark families: `list_benchmark_family_manifest_entries()`, `get_benchmark_family_manifest_entry(name)`
- Release packaging: `build_release_version()`, `export_release_dataset(...)`, `export_release_benchmark(...)`, `run_release_nightly(...)`

## Primary Commands

```bash
make setup
make check
make test
make llm-live
make deps-audit
make all
```

If you do not have LLM credentials:

```bash
VEI_LLM_LIVE_BYPASS=1 make llm-live
```

## Supported CLI Surface

- Runtime: `vei-llm-test`, `vei-smoke`, `vei-demo`, `vei-world`
- Ontology: `vei-blueprint bundle|bundles|asset|compile|show|observe|orient|examples|facades`
- Release/Ops: `vei-release dataset|benchmark|nightly`
- Scenarios: `vei-scenarios list|manifest|dump`
- DSL/corpus: `vei-det sample-workflow|compile-workflow|run-workflow|generate-corpus|filter-corpus`
- Policy/eval: `vei-rollout`, `vei-train`, `vei-eval`, `vei-eval-frontier`, `vei-score`
- Showcase: `vei-eval showcase`
- Visualization: `vei-visualize replay|flow|dashboard|export`

`vei-world graphs` now renders runtime capability graphs from stored snapshots, which is the cleanest way to inspect identity, doc, work, comm, and revenue state without dropping down into app-shaped component dumps. `vei-world orient` and `vei-blueprint orient` add the agent-facing layer on top: visible surfaces, active policy hints, key objects, and suggested next questions.

## Benchmarking

Baseline run:

```bash
export VEI_ARTIFACTS_DIR=_vei_out/llmtest
VEI_SEED=42042 vei-llm-test \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --max-steps 32 \
  --task "Open product page, cite specs, post approval under $3200, email sales@macrocompute.example for a quote, wait for reply."
vei-score --artifacts-dir _vei_out/llmtest --success-mode full
```

Kernel-backed benchmark run:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner scripted \
  --scenario multi_channel \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id scripted_multi
```

Family-level benchmark run:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner workflow \
  --family security_containment \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id security_workflow
```

Explicit workflow selection for a single scenario:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner workflow \
  --scenario oauth_app_containment \
  --workflow-name security_containment \
  --workflow-variant internal_only_review \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id security_named_workflow
```

Scripted or LLM family runs stay on the same pipeline:

```bash
vei-eval benchmark \
  --runner scripted \
  --family security_containment \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/benchmark \
  --run-id security_family
```

Canonical family demo flow:

```bash
vei-eval demo \
  --family security_containment \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/demo \
  --run-id security_demo
```

That command runs the deterministic family workflow baseline plus a comparison runner, writes `leaderboard.md` / `leaderboard.csv` / `leaderboard.json`, stores inspectable world state under `_vei_out/demo/security_demo/state` for follow-up `vei-world` inspection, and records explicit `contract.json` artifacts for both the baseline and comparison paths. Contract evaluation now separates oracle state from agent-visible observation so hidden state can be graded without making the demo omniscient.

Complex-example showcase bundle:

```bash
vei-eval showcase \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/showcase \
  --run-id flagship_examples
```

That command runs three curated complex examples and writes one top-level `showcase_overview.md` bundle plus per-example demo artifacts:

- `oauth_incident_chain`: Google Admin + SIEM + Jira + Docs + Slack
- `acquired_seller_cutover`: HRIS + Okta + Google Admin + Salesforce + Jira + Docs + Slack
- `checkout_revenue_flightdeck`: Datadog + PagerDuty + feature flags + Spreadsheet + Docs + CRM + Tickets + Slack

It is the cleanest supported way to show that VEI can execute long-horizon, cross-surface enterprise tasks rather than only single-family demos.

Flagship blueprint-driven revenue/ops demo:

```bash
vei-blueprint asset \
  --family revenue_incident_mitigation \
  --workflow-variant revenue_ops_flightdeck

vei-blueprint compile \
  --family revenue_incident_mitigation \
  --workflow-variant revenue_ops_flightdeck

vei-eval demo \
  --family revenue_incident_mitigation \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/demo \
  --run-id revenue_ops_demo
```

That flow shows the full engine shape: authored `BlueprintAsset`, compiled blueprint, the deterministic workflow baseline, a freer comparison run, `contract.json`, and inspectable state/snapshot artifacts. The flagship revenue workflow now spans Spreadsheet, Docs, CRM, feature flags, Datadog, PagerDuty, Tickets, and Slack in one mixed-stack run.

Flagship environment-builder example for the identity/access-governance wedge:

```bash
vei-blueprint examples

vei-blueprint bundle \
  --example acquired_user_cutover

vei-blueprint asset \
  --example acquired_user_cutover

vei-blueprint compile \
  --example acquired_user_cutover

vei-blueprint observe \
  --example acquired_user_cutover \
  --focus slack
```

That flow shows the full builder ladder: raw grounding bundle, authored blueprint asset, compiled blueprint, and then a live world observation. The current built-in identity wedge compiles capability graphs for HRIS, Okta-style identity, Google Drive sharing state, Jira tracking, docs, Slack, and CRM handoff.

Agent-facing builder orientation:

```bash
vei-blueprint orient \
  --example acquired_user_cutover
```

That command renders the compiled blueprint, runtime capability graphs, and a concise orientation payload for the live world. It is the cleanest single command for showing what an LLM can discover about the environment before acting.

Canonical multi-family workflow suite:

```bash
vei-eval suite \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/suite \
  --run-id nightly_suite
```

That command runs each family's primary workflow variant and writes stable `leaderboard.*` artifacts plus `suite_result.json`, which makes it a good fit for CI or nightly publishing. Each family case also writes a `contract.json` artifact so the suite has an explicit contract layer, not just score files.

Frontier batch for one model:

```bash
vei-eval-frontier run \
  --runner llm \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --scenario-set reasoning \
  --artifacts-root _vei_out/frontier_eval
```

Artifacts from batch evaluation include:

- `aggregate_results.json`
- per-scenario `benchmark_result.json`
- benchmark runs also write `blueprint_asset.json`
- benchmark runs also write `blueprint.json`
- `benchmark_summary.json`
- benchmark-family runs also write `contract.json`
- demo runs also write `leaderboard.md`, `leaderboard.csv`, `leaderboard.json`, and `demo_result.json`
- suite runs also write `leaderboard.md`, `leaderboard.csv`, `leaderboard.json`, and `suite_result.json`
- family-level dimension scores such as evidence preservation, blast radius, least privilege, oversharing avoidance, deadline compliance, revenue impact handling, artifact follow-through, comms correctness, and safe rollback

Render a report from any benchmark or frontier batch:

```bash
vei-report generate \
  --root _vei_out/frontier_eval/<run-id> \
  --format markdown \
  --output LEADERBOARD.md
```

## Contributor Notes

`bd` state is local-only under `.beads/` and should stay out of Git.

## Workspace Hygiene

The repo source of truth is:

- `vei/`
- `tests/`
- `docs/`
- `tools/`
- top-level config such as `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, and `.agents.yml`

Local-only generated folders such as `_vei_out/`, `.artifacts/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, and `vei.egg-info/` are disposable.

To prune local clutter while keeping the current canonical demo, latest live artifact, reusable datasets, your virtualenv, local `bd` state, and local Codex state:

```bash
make clean-workspace
```

`archive_data/` is intentionally left alone by that target because it may contain local imported source data rather than regenerated outputs.
