# VEI Architecture

VEI is a deterministic, MCP-native enterprise simulator built around one stable boundary: `WorldSession`.

## Core Primitives

- `Blueprint`
  - authored asset compiled into scenario, facades, workflow, contract, and run defaults
- `BlueprintAsset`
  - authoring root for scenario templates, capability-graph or environment seed data, facade requirements, and workflow defaults
- `CompiledBlueprint`
  - resolved facade/state-root graph plus workflow/contract/run defaults
- `GroundingBundle`
  - typed imported org/policy/incident bundle that compiles into a `BlueprintAsset`
- `ImportPackage`
  - raw file-based intake package with source manifests, mapping profiles, redaction state, and provenance anchors
- `Scenario`
  - seeded enterprise world plus manifest metadata
- `Facade`
  - typed enterprise surface grouped by capability domain
- `Contract`
  - explicit success predicates, forbidden predicates, observation boundary, policy invariants, reward terms, and intervention rules
- `Run`
  - workflow, benchmark, demo, showcase, and suite executions
- `Snapshot`
  - branchable world-state checkpoint over the kernel

## Runtime Shape

```text
Workspace / CLI / UI / SDK / Agent
                │
                ▼
         Project + Run surfaces
                │
                ▼
         Router transport layer
                │
                ▼
          WorldSession kernel
          ├─ world state
          ├─ event queue
          ├─ actor state
          ├─ receipts
          ├─ snapshots / branch / restore
          └─ replay / injection
```

The router is a transport and tool-dispatch adapter. Mutable enterprise state belongs to the kernel, not to transport wrappers.

## Product Workflow Layer

VEI now has a product-shaped layer above the kernel:

- `vei.workspace`
  - file-backed workspace/project model
  - blueprint asset, contract, scenario, compile records, and run registry
- `vei.run`
  - unified run manifest, canonical append-only run event stream, snapshot references, and contract summary
- `vei.ui`
  - local FastAPI + SSE playback/debug app over workspace and run APIs
  - control-room style playback surface for launch, timeline, contract, graph, and snapshot inspection
- `vei.visualization`
  - shared flow/timeline shaping for CLI and UI playback surfaces

The intended loop is:

1. create or import a workspace
2. compile or refresh runnable scenario artifacts when the workspace changes
3. launch a run
4. inspect orientation, graphs, timeline, snapshots, and diffs
5. replay, branch, or export from there through the current expert surfaces such as `vei-world`, `vei-visualize`, and release/export tooling

Imported identity workspaces now add an earlier preparation ladder:

1. validate an `ImportPackage`
2. review mapping diagnostics and scaffold source overrides where needed
3. optionally sync a live source snapshot into the same import area
4. normalize it into a `GroundingBundle`
5. compile into workspace artifacts
6. generate scenario candidates and activate the right workspace scenario
7. bootstrap contracts
8. launch runs against the generated scenarios
9. inspect diagnostics, event playback, and provenance in the same workspace/UI flow

For the canonical product demo, `vei project identity-demo` wraps that ladder into one opinionated identity/access-governance flow and optionally launches the baseline plus scripted comparison runs for the active generated scenario.

## Software Twins

- Collaboration: Slack, Mail
- Knowledge: Browser, Docs
- Operations: Tickets, ServiceDesk
- Identity and control plane: Okta-style identity, Google Admin, SIEM, Datadog, PagerDuty, feature flags
- Business systems: ERP, CRM, HRIS, Jira-style issues
- Office/data surfaces: Spreadsheet

## Capability Domains

VEI keeps the current router twins, but the public ontology now groups them as facades under capability domains:

- `comm_graph`
  - Slack, Mail, Calendar
- `doc_graph`
  - Browser, Docs
- `work_graph`
  - Tickets, ServiceDesk, Jira
- `identity_graph`
  - Identity, Google Admin, HRIS
- `revenue_graph`
  - CRM
- `obs_graph`
  - SIEM, Datadog, PagerDuty
- `ops_graph`
  - Feature flags, ERP
- `data_graph`
  - Database, Spreadsheet

## Design Rules

- New mutable state belongs under `vei.world`.
- Cross-module usage should go through typed `api.py` surfaces.
- All actor outputs should enter the world through typed events so snapshot/replay stays deterministic.
- New software environments should register as facade plugins before they become public blueprint/compiler surfaces.
- Prefer `GroundingBundle -> BlueprintAsset -> CompiledBlueprint -> WorldSession` as the environment-builder path.
- Prefer `ImportPackage -> GroundingBundle -> BlueprintAsset -> CompiledBlueprint -> WorldSession` when working from real or sanitized enterprise exports.
- Prefer live connector snapshots to land as persisted `ImportPackage` sources rather than creating a second ingestion path.
- Prefer reviewable file-based intake: raw sources -> validation/review -> optional mapping overrides -> normalized bundle -> generated scenarios -> activated workspace scenario.
- Prefer reconciled identity subjects over any single source export when imported Okta, HRIS, ticket, or share principals disagree.
- Prefer the run event stream as the runtime source of truth for playback, receipts, contract progress, and snapshot markers.
- Prefer contract rules to carry provenance that says which rules were imported, derived, or simulated and which tenant objects they apply to.
- Prefer `WorldSession -> capability_graphs() -> graph_plan() -> graph_action()` as the main agent-facing planning/mutation ladder inside a live world.
- Use `orientation()` to help agents discover the world before they begin mutating it.
- Prefer graph-native workflow steps for long-horizon playbooks when the intent is domain-level mutation rather than a specific vendor surface.
- Prefer semantic environment building first. VM-backed or OS-level facades are future plugin substrates, not the core runtime model.
- Preserve imported-vs-derived-vs-simulated provenance through normalization, workspace storage, run timelines, and UI inspection.
