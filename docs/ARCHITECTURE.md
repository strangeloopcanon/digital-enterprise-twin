# VEI Architecture

Use `README.md` for install and operator flows, `docs/OVERVIEW.md` for product framing, and this document for module boundaries, runtime shape, and subsystem relationships.

VEI is a deterministic, MCP-native enterprise simulator built around one stable boundary: `WorldSession`.

## Core Primitives

- `Blueprint`
  - authored asset compiled into scenario, facades, workflow, contract, and run defaults
- `BlueprintAsset`
  - authoring root for scenario templates, capability-graph or environment seed data, facade requirements, and workflow defaults
- `CompiledBlueprint`
  - resolved facade/state-root graph plus workflow/contract/run defaults
- `GroundingBundle`
  - typed imported org/policy/incident bundle that compiles into a `BlueprintAsset`
- `ImportPackage`
  - raw file-based intake package with source manifests, mapping profiles, redaction state, and provenance anchors
- `Scenario`
  - seeded enterprise world plus manifest metadata
- `Facade`
  - typed enterprise surface grouped by capability domain
- `Contract`
  - explicit success predicates, forbidden predicates, observation boundary, policy invariants, reward terms, and intervention rules
- `Run`
  - workflow, benchmark, demo, showcase, and suite executions
- `Snapshot`
  - branchable world-state checkpoint over the kernel

## One Kernel, Four Modes

VEI is one kernel with four operating modes sharing the same world session, connector layer, event spine, replay model, and contract scoring:

- **Test / Eval** — run a fixed company world, score an agent, compare scripted vs LLM vs workflow runners
- **Mirror / Control** — place VEI between agents and enterprise systems; govern, record, and replay what happened
- **Sandbox / What-if** — fork the same world, change policy or actions, compare alternate futures with world-state diffs
- **Train / Data** — turn traces and trajectories into rollouts, demonstrations, and RL-friendly data

## Runtime Shape

        └───────┬───────┘
                ▼
          WorldSession kernel
          ├─ world state
          ├─ event queue
          ├─ actor state + receipts
          ├─ snapshots / branch / restore
          ├─ replay / injection
          └─ mirror runtime (agent fleet, approvals, throttles, event feed)
```

The router is a transport and tool-dispatch adapter. The twin gateway is an HTTP adapter that exposes provider-shaped compatibility routes and manages mirror agents. Mutable enterprise state belongs to the kernel, not to transport wrappers.

## Product Workflow Layer

VEI now has a product-shaped layer above the kernel:

- `vei.workspace`
  - file-backed workspace/project model
  - blueprint asset, contract, scenario, compile records, and run registry
- `vei.run`
  - unified run manifest, canonical append-only run event stream, snapshot references, and contract summary
- `vei.ui`
  - local FastAPI + SSE playback/debug app over workspace and run APIs
  - control-room style playback surface for launch, timeline, contract, graph, and snapshot inspection
  - Living Company View that turns the latest run snapshot into a normalized software wall for chat, mail, work tracking, documents, approvals, and the vertical heartbeat
  - Mirror mode indicator banner and Control Plane panel (agent cards, policy badges, approval queue, connector strip, readable activity log)
  - Sandbox features: fork-from-here on snapshots, Compare Paths button, snapshot pickers, cross-run world-state diff grouped by domain, and `service_ops` policy replay
- `vei.playable`
  - mission catalog, move model, scorecards, branch helpers, export previews, and playable release bundles
  - fork from any snapshot with move-history rewind via optional `snapshot_id` parameter
- `vei.fidelity`
  - twin-fidelity validation harness for the surfaces that make playable worlds credible
- `vei.visualization`
  - shared flow/timeline shaping for CLI and UI playback surfaces

The intended loop is:

1. create or import a workspace
2. compile or refresh runnable scenario artifacts when the workspace changes
3. launch a run
4. inspect orientation, graphs, timeline, snapshots, and diffs
5. replay, branch, or export from there through the current expert surfaces such as `vei world`, `vei visualize`, and release/export tooling

Imported identity workspaces now add an earlier preparation ladder:

1. validate an `ImportPackage`
2. review mapping diagnostics and scaffold source overrides where needed
3. optionally sync a live source snapshot into the same import area
4. normalize it into a `GroundingBundle`
5. compile into workspace artifacts
6. generate scenario candidates and activate the right workspace scenario
7. bootstrap contracts
8. launch runs against the generated scenarios
9. inspect diagnostics, event playback, and provenance in the same workspace/UI flow

For the canonical product demo, `vei project identity-demo` wraps that ladder into one opinionated identity/access-governance flow and optionally launches the baseline plus scripted comparison runs for the active generated scenario.

## Mirror / Control Plane Layer

- `vei.mirror`
  - `MirrorRuntime` — agent registry, event ingest, approval queue, rate limiting, demo autoplay, snapshot generation
  - public mirror surface stays in `vei.mirror.api`, with internal split across `_config.py`, `_demo.py`, and `_runtime.py`
  - `MirrorAgentSpec` — typed model for registered agents with role, team, allowed surfaces, policy profile, status, `last_action`, `denied_count`, and `throttled_count`
  - `MirrorPendingApproval` / `MirrorPolicyProfile` / `MirrorConnectorStatus` — typed models for held actions, built-in agent permissions, and operator-facing surface status
  - `MirrorRecentEvent` — bounded ring buffer entries for the recent-event feed
  - `MirrorRuntimeSnapshot` — typed fleet snapshot including agents, resolved profiles, approvals, connector status, config, and recent events
- `vei.twin`
  - `CustomerTwinBundle` — builds a customer-shaped twin from a context snapshot and vertical archetype
  - `TwinRuntime` — FastAPI runtime behind `vei.twin.gateway`, with helper, route, and runtime internals separated for the compatibility layer
  - Mirror decision pipeline: registration, agent mode, allowed surface, policy profile, connector safety, rate limit, then execution
  - Surface and policy denials, approval-required holds, unsupported live writes, and rate limits are recorded in the run timeline and exposed through provider-shaped responses
- `vei.pilot`
  - higher-level flow for local agent demos: starts twin gateway, Studio, and Pilot Console sidecar
  - writes launch manifest, handoff guide, and runtime state

## Sandbox / What-if Layer

- `vei.run.api`
  - `diff_cross_run_snapshots()` — compare world states between two snapshots from different runs, stripping branch-local metadata and returning added/removed/changed fields
- `vei.playable.api`
  - stable public surface over grouped internal modules for mission flow, exports, and policy replay
  - `branch_workspace_mission_run(..., snapshot_id=...)` — fork a playable mission from any historical snapshot, rewinding move history to that point
  - `get_service_ops_policy_bundle()` / `replay_service_ops_with_policy_delta()` — service-ops-only what-if replay over four named policy knobs from the initial snapshot
- `vei.ui.api`
  - stable public surface over grouped route registrars for workspace/mirror, playable, run, and imports/context endpoints
  - `GET /api/runs/diff-cross` — HTTP endpoint for cross-run snapshot comparison
  - `POST /api/missions/{run_id}/branch` with optional `snapshot_id` — fork from any snapshot via the UI
  - `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/policy-knobs` / `POST /api/runs/{run_id}/replay-with-policy` — service-ops policy replay endpoints used by the Studio outcome flow
  - Studio browser code is loaded as ordered plain scripts (`studio-core.js`, `studio-compare.js`, `studio-company.js`, `studio-outcome.js`, `studio-bootstrap.js`) rather than one giant frontend file

## Context and Synthesis Layer

- `vei.context`
  - context capture from live enterprise APIs (Slack, Gmail, Teams, Jira, Google, Okta)
  - `ContextSnapshot` — structured record of a company's current state
- `vei.synthesis`
  - extract runbooks, training data, and agent configs from completed world runs
- `vei.connectors`
  - adapter layer routing tool calls through simulated, replay, or live backends
  - policy gates classifying operations as READ, WRITE_SAFE, or WRITE_RISKY

## Software Twins

- Collaboration: Slack, Mail

- Business systems: ERP, CRM, HRIS, Jira-style issues
- Office/data surfaces: Spreadsheet
- Vertical domain adapters: Property operations, campaign operations, inventory operations

## Capability Domains

VEI keeps the current router twins, but the public ontology now groups them as facades under capability domains:

- `comm_graph`
  - Slack, Mail, Calendar
- `doc_graph`
  - Browser, Docs
- `work_graph`
  - Tickets, ServiceDesk, Jira
- `identity_graph`
  - Identity, Google Admin, HRIS
- `revenue_graph`
  - CRM
- `obs_graph`
  - SIEM, Datadog, PagerDuty
- `ops_graph`
  - Feature flags, ERP
- `data_graph`
  - Database, Spreadsheet
- `property_graph`
  - properties, buildings, units, leases, vendors, work orders
- `campaign_graph`
  - clients, campaigns, creatives, budgets, approvals, reports
- `inventory_graph`
  - sites, capacity pools, storage units, quotes, orders, allocations

## Design Rules

- New mutable state belongs under `vei.world`.
- Cross-module usage should go through typed `api.py` surfaces.
- All actor outputs should enter the world through typed events so snapshot/replay stays deterministic.
- New software environments should register as facade plugins before they become public blueprint/compiler surfaces.
- Prefer `GroundingBundle -> BlueprintAsset -> CompiledBlueprint -> WorldSession` as the environment-builder path.
- Prefer `ImportPackage -> GroundingBundle -> BlueprintAsset -> CompiledBlueprint -> WorldSession` when working from real or sanitized enterprise exports.
- Prefer live connector snapshots to land as persisted `ImportPackage` sources rather than creating a second ingestion path.
- Prefer reviewable file-based intake: raw sources -> validation/review -> optional mapping overrides -> normalized bundle -> generated scenarios -> activated workspace scenario.
- Prefer reconciled identity subjects over any single source export when imported Okta, HRIS, ticket, or share principals disagree.
- Prefer the run event stream as the runtime source of truth for playback, receipts, contract progress, and snapshot markers.
- Prefer contract rules to carry provenance that says which rules were imported, derived, or simulated and which tenant objects they apply to.
- Prefer `WorldSession -> capability_graphs() -> graph_plan() -> graph_action()` as the main agent-facing planning/mutation ladder inside a live world.
- Use `orientation()` to help agents discover the world before they begin mutating it.
- Prefer graph-native workflow steps for long-horizon playbooks when the intent is domain-level mutation rather than a specific vendor surface.
- Prefer semantic environment building first. VM-backed or OS-level facades are future plugin substrates, not the core runtime model.
- Preserve imported-vs-derived-vs-simulated provenance through normalization, workspace storage, run timelines, and UI inspection.
- Prefer vertical world packs to be first-class workspaces that exercise the same kernel, run spine, contracts, and UI as the rest of the product, not a separate demo framework.
- Prefer scenario variants and contract variants to behave as overlays on a stable world pack rather than cloned one-off demo environments.
- Prefer mission play to sit on top of the same graph-native action ladder and run/event spine instead of inventing a game-only runtime.
- Prefer fidelity checks that validate the real boundary behavior of the important twins before shipping a playable mission bundle.
- The vertical demos should always reinforce the platform thesis: domain packs change capability graphs and contracts, while the kernel, event spine, replay model, and playback UI stay the same. That is what lets VEI become an RL environment, a continuous-eval stack, and an agent-management platform later without replacing the core runtime.
