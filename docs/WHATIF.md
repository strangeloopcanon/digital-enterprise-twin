# Historical What-Ifs

VEI now supports a mail-first historical what-if workflow for archive-backed datasets such as the Enron Rosetta event tables.

The flow has four steps:

1. Explore the whole history to see what a rule or intervention would have touched.
2. Pick one exact historical event.
3. Materialize that event's thread into a strict historical workspace.
4. Compare the baseline future against one or more counterfactual paths.

Studio now supports this same loop directly:

1. search the archive for a real historical moment
2. choose one event from the results
3. materialize the baseline workspace
4. run the counterfactual and inspect the saved comparison bundle

## Why this shape

VEI does not try to turn an entire historical corpus into one giant always-running simulation. That would be slower, heavier, and harder to understand in a demo.

Instead, the system uses two connected layers:

- **Whole-history analysis** for broad questions such as “what would this policy have caught?”
- **Event-level replay** for one chosen moment, where VEI can branch, replay, and compare outcomes inside a normal world workspace

This keeps the whole-history pass deterministic and cheap while still giving us a true replay environment for the interesting moment.

## What gets materialized

When VEI opens a historical episode, it builds a mail-first workspace from the selected thread:

- messages before the selected event become the initial mail state
- the selected event and later historical messages become scheduled replay events
- observed thread participants become identity records
- policy-relevant annotations stay attached for analysis and scoring

The important constraint is honesty:

- VEI does **not** invent Slack history for archive-backed email episodes
- VEI keeps historical body excerpts labeled as excerpts when the source data is truncated
- unsupported surfaces stay disabled instead of being faked

## Compare paths

There are two compare paths today:

- **LLM actor continuation**
  - bounded email-only continuation on the affected thread
  - limited to the known thread participants and allowed recipients
  - defaults to `gpt-5-mini` so the interactive run completes quickly and predictably
  - useful for “what would someone have said or done next?”
- **E-JEPA forecast**
  - real checkpoint-backed forecast for risk and volume deltas when the local `ARP_Jepa_exp` runtime is available
  - trained on a deterministic local slice of related threads around the chosen branch point, so the forecast stays tied to the exact decision you are changing
  - falls back to the proxy forecast only when that runtime is missing or errors
  - useful for “how much would this likely reduce exposure, escalation, or follow-up volume?”

```

## Artifacts

`vei whatif experiment` writes a result bundle that includes:

- experiment result JSON
- experiment overview Markdown
- LLM path JSON
- forecast path JSON
- the strict replay workspace used for the run

The forecast bundle is written as `whatif_ejepa_result.json` when the real JEPA path runs, or `whatif_ejepa_proxy_result.json` when the fallback path is used.

This makes it easy to inspect the result in Studio later, compare runs, or hand the output to another tool.

## Live Enron display in Studio

Use the saved Enron workspace directly when you want the screen to show Enron itself.

```bash
VEI_WHATIF_ROSETTA_DIR=/path/to/rosetta \
vei ui serve \
  --root /path/to/saved-enron-result/workspace \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 3055
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3055` and stay inside that workspace. This keeps the display tied to the actual Enron branch point and the actual saved result.

## Enron business-outcome benchmark

The historical replay flow above is for one branch point and one saved comparison. The Enron benchmark is for repeated measurement across many branch points.

This benchmark answers a different question:

- given only the history before the branch point
- and one structured candidate action
- what later business-relevant email evidence becomes more or less likely

The benchmark keeps the older replay and ranked what-if flows intact. It adds a separate benchmark path for business-facing proxy outcomes:

- `enterprise_risk`
- `commercial_position_proxy`
- `org_strain_proxy`
- `stakeholder_trust`
- `execution_drag`

Those scores come from later email evidence that the archive can actually support:

- outside spread
- legal burden
- executive heat
- coordination load
- decision drag
- trust or repair language
- conflict heat
- artifact churn

All trained model families use the same boundary for this benchmark:

- pre-branch thread history only
- structured candidate action only

The matched-input benchmark study now gives `jepa_latent` and `full_context_transformer` the same pre-branch event sequence, summary features, and action schema. That makes the main rerun a clean model comparison instead of a mixed input comparison.

`vei whatif benchmark judge` writes:

- `judge_result.json`
- `audit_queue.json`

`vei whatif benchmark eval` writes:

- factual forecasting metrics
- judged counterfactual ranking metrics
- audit coverage and agreement metrics
- rollout stress metrics only as a separate section

`vei whatif benchmark study` writes:

- one aggregate JSON result
- one Markdown overview
- one seeded run folder per model under `studies/<label>/runs/...`

### Current model state

The current saved Enron reset build uses 24 held-out cases with 4 candidate actions each. The current headline result is the matched-input study rerun over that build, not the older single-run comparison.

On the current 5-seed, 2-epoch matched-input rerun, the held-out decision checks came out like this:

- `jepa_latent`: `76.6/120` mean, `0.638 +/- 0.022`
- `full_context_transformer`: `75.2/120` mean, `0.627 +/- 0.025`
- `treatment_transformer`: `65.6/120` mean, `0.547 +/- 0.108`

On the factual question of whether anything goes outside after the branch point, all three models stayed tightly grouped around `0.98` AUROC.

The practical read is that the fair rerun changed the story. Once the models read the same pre-branch contract and the result is averaged across seeds, the JEPA-style path slightly leads the matched full-context transformer on the Enron decision checks, while the treatment transformer shows the widest spread from seed to seed.

### Important constraint

This benchmark stays honest about the source data. Enron email can support business proxies. It does not support true profit ground truth or true HR outcome ground truth.
