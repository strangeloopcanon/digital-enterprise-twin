# Changelog

## Unreleased - 2026-03-10

- Added a first-class `WorldSession` kernel and promoted `vei.world.api` as the stable platform boundary for full-world observe, snapshot, restore, branch, replay, inject, and event controls.
- Reworked the benchmark/eval stack onto the kernel, including reusable benchmark families for security containment, onboarding/migration, and revenue incident response plus reusable enterprise scoring dimensions.
- Added deterministic enterprise/control-plane twins for Google Admin, SIEM, Datadog, PagerDuty, feature flags, HRIS, and Jira-style issue workflows.
- Added release/export tooling (`vei-release`) with benchmark/dataset manifests and a nightly GitHub Actions workflow.
- Added the `vei-world` CLI surface and kept `vei-state` as a compatibility alias.
- Licensed the repository under Business Source License 1.1 and removed tracked `.beads/` state from version control.
